# Description

This is a humble ToDo list web app.
The project is for self education purpose.

# Features
- To-Do app is implemented as a JS class;
- Each app instance can be rendered in multiple Divs simultaneously;
- If app is rendered in multiple places, all views are dynamically synchronized;
- Bootstrap is used for styling;
- I mainly used CSS to animate tasks deleting/marking;
